WARNING: drivers/platform/x86/dell-uart-backlight.o(.text+0x8af): Section mismatch in reference from the function dell_uart_bl_add() to the variable .init.rodata:dell_uart_backlight_alpha_platform
The function dell_uart_bl_add() references
the variable __initconst dell_uart_backlight_alpha_platform.
This is often because dell_uart_bl_add lacks a __initconst 
annotation or the annotation of dell_uart_backlight_alpha_platform is wrong.
